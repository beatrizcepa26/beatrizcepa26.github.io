I am a Ph.D. Student and Researcher at the High-Assurance Software Laboratory (HASLab), INESC TEC. My academic journey has allowed me to contact and work in fields such as Machine and Deep Learning, Distributed and Web Applications, and Medical Imaging Informatics. Currently, my research is focused on Medical Imaging Informatics (namely, MRI image processing and analysis) and Distributed Systems.
