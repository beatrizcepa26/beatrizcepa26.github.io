I am a Ph.D. Student and Research Assistant at the High-Assurance Software Laboratory (HASLab), INESC TEC. My research focuses on High-Performance Computing and Medical Imaging, specifically in optimizing MRI image processing tools in a large-scale environment to reduce execution times and allow for processing multiple subjects at the same time. My research interests also include Deep Learning and Applications for healthcare.
